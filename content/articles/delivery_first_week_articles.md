# ParentLogs: Delivery & First Week Articles for First-Time Dads

===ARTICLE 1: THE DELIVERY ROOM: DAD'S ROLE===

## The Delivery Room: Dad's Role

**The Quick Brief**

Labor and delivery will be one of the most intense experiences of your life—hours of waiting, moments of terror, and ultimately, profound awe. Your job isn't to fix anything or know everything. It's to be present, advocate fiercely, and stay calm when everyone else can't.

---

**What's Happening with Baby**

During labor, your baby is doing serious work. They're rotating through the birth canal, their skull bones temporarily molding to fit through. Their heart rate is being monitored because this journey stresses them too.

For vaginal delivery, you might see your baby emerge looking startled, cone-headed, and potentially covered in vernix (white waxy coating) and blood. This is completely normal. Their first cry is their lungs opening for the first time—and it's the best sound you'll ever hear.

For C-section, baby is lifted out through an incision. They may appear more "pristine" since they didn't make the trip through the birth canal. Either way, baby will likely be placed on mom's chest immediately for skin-to-skin contact if possible.

Normal newborn appearance: bluish hands and feet (they warm up), squished features, swollen eyes, possibly some bruising from delivery, and yes—they don't look like the babies in diaper commercials. Yet.

---

**What's Happening with Mom**

Your partner is running a marathon while passing a bowling ball. Labor contractions intensify over hours, and she's managing pain while her body does something extraordinary.

Vaginal delivery involves significant physical exertion. The pushing stage can last anywhere from minutes to hours. Afterward, there may be tearing that requires stitches. Her body has just performed an incredible feat, and she'll be exhausted, emotional, and possibly in shock.

C-section is major abdominal surgery. She'll be awake but numb from the chest down. Recovery is longer and more restrictive—she won't be able to lift anything heavier than the baby for weeks. The incision needs time to heal, and moving around will be painful initially.

In both cases, immediately after delivery, her body begins a massive hormonal shift. She may experience uncontrollable shaking, which is normal. The placenta must be delivered, and there will be significant bleeding (lochia) that continues for weeks.

---

**What Dad Should Do Now**

**1. Be the Advocate**
Know her birth preferences beforehand. When medical staff ask questions and she's mid-contraction, you speak up. "She wants to avoid an epidural if possible" or "She's open to all pain management options." You're her voice when she can't speak.

**2. Provide Physical Support**
Hip squeezes during contractions can provide real relief—press firmly on her hip bones during peaks. Offer ice chips, hold her hand, help her change positions. If she's using a birthing ball or wants to walk, support her physically.

**3. Coach Breathing, Not Cheerleading**
Forget "you're doing great!" on repeat—it can become annoying. Instead, breathe with her through contractions. Slow, audible exhales. Be the metronome she can follow when pain scrambles her brain.

**4. Stay Calm (Fake It If Necessary)**
You might see blood, bodily fluids, and medical interventions that shock you. Your face is the one she'll read. Keep it calm, reassuring, confident. If you feel faint, sit down—don't become another patient.

**5. For C-Section: Be at Her Head**
You'll sit by her head, holding her hand. A curtain blocks the surgical view. Your job is to keep her calm, narrate when baby arrives, and cut the cord if invited. Don't peek over the curtain unless you have a steel stomach.

---

**The Relationship Check-In**

This is not the time for relationship processing—it's survival mode. But know this: you're in the foxhole together. Forgive harsh words said during contractions. She may squeeze your hand until it bruises, or tell you to stop touching her entirely. Both are normal.

Your only goal right now is to be present and useful. There will be time later to talk about the experience. Right now, be the steady presence she needs.

---

**What's Coming Up**

Once baby is born, immediate assessments happen (APGAR scores at 1 and 5 minutes). If all is well, baby goes to mom for skin-to-skin. Breastfeeding may start within the first hour. You'll move to a recovery room, and the real learning begins.

===ARTICLE 2: THE FIRST 24 HOURS===

## The First 24 Hours

**The Quick Brief**

Your baby is here. The adrenaline is still pumping, but reality is setting in. The next 24 hours are a blur of hospital procedures, learning basic baby care from nurses, and trying to process what just happened. Sleep when offered—you won't get much once you're home.

---

**What's Happening with Baby**

Your newborn is transitioning from womb to world, and that's a lot of work for them.

**Normal appearance:** Still cone-headed, potentially jaundiced (yellowish skin, especially by day 2-3), swollen eyelids, possibly some baby acne or white spots called milia. Their skin may peel—this is normal, not a problem to solve.

**Normal behaviors:** Sleeping 16-17 hours in 2-3 hour chunks. Feeding every 2-3 hours (8-12 times per day). Crying that sounds different from what you expected. Hiccups, sneezes, and grunting sounds that seem alarming but are normal.

**First poop:** Meconium—thick, tarry, black-green substance. This is everything they ingested in utero. By day 3-5, it should transition to brown, then yellow (if breastfed) or tan (if formula fed).

**Reflexes:** Baby should startle at loud noises (Moro reflex), turn toward things that touch their cheek (rooting), and grip your finger (palmar grasp). Nurses will check these.

**Weight loss:** Babies lose 5-10% of birth weight in first days. This is normal. Pediatrician will monitor this closely.

---

**What's Happening with Mom**

She just completed a major physical event and is now beginning recovery while simultaneously learning to care for a newborn. Her body is doing a lot right now.

**Physical state:** If vaginal delivery, perineal soreness or stitches. She'll have heavy bleeding (lochia rubra)—the hospital will provide heavy-duty pads and mesh underwear (surprisingly beloved). If C-section, she's recovering from major surgery with an incision that needs careful attention.

**Hormonal shift:** The massive pregnancy hormones are crashing. She may feel emotionally all over the place—euphoric one moment, weeping the next. This is the beginning of the "baby blues" (distinct from postpartum depression, which comes later).

**Exhaustion:** She hasn't slept well in months, just went through labor, and now a tiny human needs her every 2-3 hours. The exhaustion is real and compounding.

**Breastfeeding:** If breastfeeding, this is when it starts. It's not intuitive for mom or baby. Lactation consultants are gold—use them. Colostrum (first milk) is thick, yellow, and comes in tiny amounts. This is normal and sufficient for baby's marble-sized stomach.

---

**What Dad Should Do Now**

**1. Be the Gatekeeper**
Everyone wants to visit. Your job is to limit the parade. She needs rest, not an audience. Keep the room calm. If visitors come, enforce time limits and read her cues—if she's exhausted, politely end the visit.

**2. Be the Runner**
She's tethered to a hospital bed recovering. You're mobile. Get her water, find the nurse, locate the lactation consultant, grab more ice packs for her perineal area, refill her snacks. Anticipate needs before she asks.

**3. Learn Everything from the Nurses**
This is your training window. Pay attention when nurses demonstrate diapering, swaddling, safe sleep positioning, and baby handling. Ask questions—they've heard everything. Watch, practice, repeat. Don't assume mom will handle all baby care.

**4. Master the Swaddle**
Hospital swaddles are like baby straitjackets. Learn the technique. A well-swaddled baby sleeps better and startles less. Practice now while nurses can correct you.

**5. Handle Paperwork and Logistics**
Birth certificate forms, social security application, insurance notifications, hospital billing questions. These pile up. Handle them so she doesn't have to think about them.

---

**The Relationship Check-In**

You're both running on empty. Lower expectations dramatically. Communicate in short, direct sentences. "What do you need?" and "I'm going to do X" are perfect.

If breastfeeding is hard (it often is), she may feel frustrated or like a failure. Your job: reassure without minimizing. "This is hard, and you're doing it" beats "It'll be fine." Don't offer solutions unless asked—sometimes she just needs to vent.

---

**What's Coming Up**

Discharge happens 24-48 hours after vaginal delivery, longer for C-section. Before you leave, confirm the first pediatrician appointment (usually 3-5 days after birth). Make sure you understand feeding schedules, warning signs to watch for, and that you have a properly installed car seat.

===ARTICLE 3: COMING HOME: DAYS 2-4===

## Coming Home: Days 2-4

**The Quick Brief**

The hospital sent you home with a tiny human and zero supervision. The nurse call button is gone. Reality hits hard. These days are about survival, not perfection. Set up your stations, establish loose routines, and accept that the house will be a disaster.

---

**What's Happening with Baby**

Baby is still adjusting to life outside the womb. Everything is new—light, sound, temperature, gravity, hunger.

**Feeding:** Still eating every 2-3 hours around the clock. If breastfeeding, mom's milk typically "comes in" around days 3-5, transitioning from colostrum to larger volumes. Baby's stomach grows from marble-sized to ping pong ball-sized. Watch for feeding cues: rooting, hand-to-mouth, fussiness before full crying.

**Sleep:** Still 16-17 hours, but in short bursts. No day/night distinction yet—that develops over weeks. Baby is doing exactly what biology intends; it just happens to destroy your sleep.

**Poop:** Transitioning from meconium (black-green) to transitional stools (brown-green) to regular newborn poop (yellow and seedy if breastfed, tan and more formed if formula fed). 3-4 bowel movements per day is normal; some babies go more.

**Cord stump:** The umbilical cord stump is still attached. Keep it clean and dry. It falls off naturally within 1-3 weeks. Don't pick at it. Slight smell is normal; foul odor or redness around base is not.

**Weight:** Baby may still be below birth weight. The pediatrician will track this closely at the first visit. As long as they're feeding well and producing wet/dirty diapers, you're on track.

---

**What's Happening with Mom**

**Physical recovery continues:** Vaginal soreness peaks around days 2-3. The bleeding (lochia) is still heavy but should gradually lighten from bright red to pink to brown over the coming weeks. If it was a C-section, she's managing incision pain, limited mobility, and needs help getting in and out of bed.

**Breast changes:** If breastfeeding, engorgement hits when milk comes in (days 3-5). Breasts become hard, hot, and painful. Frequent feeding helps. Cold compresses between feedings, warm compresses before. If not breastfeeding, engorgement still happens and requires cold packs and firm support—no pumping or stimulation.

**The hormone crash:** Days 3-5 are the emotional low point for many women. The baby blues hit hardest now—crying spells, anxiety, feeling overwhelmed, mood swings. This is biochemistry, not weakness. It typically resolves within 2 weeks.

**Sleep deprivation:** She hasn't slept more than 2-3 hours consecutively in days. This compounds everything—physical pain feels worse, emotions run higher, patience runs lower.

---

**What Dad Should Do Now**

**1. Run All House Operations**
Cooking, cleaning, laundry, groceries, dishes. If it's not baby care or her own recovery, you handle it. She should only need to focus on feeding baby and healing herself. Everything else is your domain.

**2. Set Up Stations**
Create efficiency zones. **Feeding station:** comfortable chair, water bottle, snacks, phone charger, burp cloths, pillow for arm support. **Diaper station:** diapers, wipes, cream, change pad—in multiple locations if you have a multi-story home. This reduces steps when you're exhausted.

**3. Establish Night Shift Rotation**
She needs consolidated sleep blocks. You both can't be up for every feeding. Options: you handle diapers and bring baby to her for feeding, then do the burping and putting baby back down. Or if bottle feeding (expressed milk or formula), take a full shift so she can get 4-5 hours straight.

**4. Be the Visitor Bouncer**
People mean well. They want to "help" by holding the baby while you host them. That's not help. Real help is dropping off food and leaving. Set expectations before visits: 30 minutes max, must bring food, no visiting if sick. Enforce this ruthlessly.

**5. Track the Data**
Feeding times, diaper counts, sleep windows. Use an app or simple notes. This data helps the pediatrician assess baby's health and helps you both spot patterns. When sleep-deprived, you won't remember without writing it down.

---

**The Relationship Check-In**

You're both in survival mode. Intimacy is not on the table—and won't be for weeks. What matters now is teamwork.

Check in with simple questions: "What's the hardest thing right now?" and "What one thing would help most?" Avoid keeping score of who's more tired—you're both destroyed. Watch for signs she's struggling beyond normal baby blues: not eating, not sleeping even when baby sleeps, withdrawing completely, expressing hopelessness.

---

**What's Coming Up**

First pediatrician visit is usually 3-5 days after birth (within 48 hours if discharged early). They'll check baby's weight, jaundice levels, and feeding progress. Come with your tracking data and questions. Her postpartum OB follow-up may be scheduled for 6 weeks out, but ACOG recommends earlier check-ins if needed.

===ARTICLE 4: THE FIRST WEEK SURVIVAL GUIDE===

## The First Week Survival Guide

**The Quick Brief**

By day 5-7, you're finding a sliver of footing. Exhaustion is the new normal. You've changed dozens of diapers, and the feeding rhythm is (maybe) starting to make sense. Now is the time to establish safe sleep, monitor mom's mental health, and survive until things stabilize.

---

**What's Happening with Baby**

**Feeding rhythm establishing:** Whether breast or bottle, feeding every 2-3 hours around the clock continues. If breastfeeding, baby should be more efficient at the breast as days pass. If formula feeding, follow volume guidelines from your pediatrician. Watch for hunger cues before baby gets to full crying—it's easier for everyone.

**Weight check:** Baby should be back to birth weight by 10-14 days. The first pediatrician visit (typically day 3-5) monitors this. Steady gain after the initial loss is the goal.

**Sleep patterns:** Still no day/night distinction. Baby sleeps 16-17 hours but in short chunks. Normal newborn behavior is to be most alert in the evening hours (when you're most exhausted).

**Normal concerning-sounding things:** Snorting, grunting, irregular breathing patterns, hiccups, random limb jerks during sleep—all usually normal. Babies are noisy sleepers.

**Things that actually warrant a call:** Fever over 100.4°F, refusing to eat multiple feedings in a row, fewer than 6 wet diapers per day, extreme lethargy, blue color around mouth, labored breathing (retractions, flaring nostrils).

---

**What's Happening with Mom**

**Baby blues peak:** Days 3-5 were the low point, but symptoms can persist through week one. Mood swings, crying spells, anxiety, and irritability are normal. She may feel disconnected from the baby—this doesn't mean she's a bad mother. It means her brain chemistry is in upheaval.

**Physical recovery continues:** Bleeding should be decreasing (still present, but not soaking pads hourly). Perineal pain should be improving. C-section incision should be healing without increased redness, swelling, or discharge.

**Sleep deprivation is dangerous:** By day 7, cumulative sleep debt is significant. This affects cognition, emotional regulation, and immune function. Prioritize her sleep over everything except baby safety.

**Breastfeeding challenges:** Nipple soreness is common. If cracking, bleeding, or severe pain occurs, consult a lactation consultant—poor latch is usually the cause. Engorgement should be improving as supply and demand equilibrate.

---

**What Dad Should Do Now**

**1. Monitor Her Mental Health**
Baby blues (lasting up to 2 weeks) is different from postpartum depression (PPD). Watch for warning signs of PPD: symptoms not improving after 2 weeks, inability to care for self or baby, complete withdrawal, expressions of hopelessness or harming herself or baby, not sleeping even when baby sleeps, not eating.

If you see these signs, this is a medical emergency. Contact her OB, a mental health crisis line, or take her to the ER. PPD is treatable but requires professional intervention.

**2. Enforce Safe Sleep Every Time**

Safe sleep prevents SIDS and accidental suffocation. The AAP and NIH guidelines are clear:

- **Back to sleep:** Baby sleeps on their back for every sleep. No exceptions.
- **Firm, flat surface:** Crib, bassinet, or play yard with a firm mattress and fitted sheet. Nothing else in the sleep space.
- **Alone:** No blankets, pillows, bumpers, stuffed animals, or positioners. Nothing except baby.
- **Room sharing, not bed sharing:** Baby's sleep space in your room for at least 6 months, but not in your bed.

When you're exhausted, the temptation to fall asleep with baby on the couch or in bed is enormous. This is when accidents happen. If you're feeding baby in bed, remove all soft bedding from your side. If you doze off, return baby to their safe sleep space as soon as you wake.

**3. Maintain the Household**
Laundry, dishes, and basic cleanliness. You don't need perfection—you need functional. Meal prep or delivery services are worth every penny. Accept every food drop-off offered.

**4. Attend the Pediatrician Visit**
Don't skip this. Come with your tracking data and questions. Common questions: Is weight gain on track? Is jaundice concerning? Are we feeding correctly? What should we watch for?

**5. Take Care of Yourself (Minimally)**
Shower daily if possible. Eat actual food. Hydrate. Take brief walks if you can. You can't support her if you collapse. But also accept that self-care is minimal right now—that's temporary.

---

**The Relationship Check-In**

You've survived the first week. This is worth acknowledging. You don't need to celebrate—you need to communicate.

Check in daily: "How are you feeling today—honestly?" Listen without fixing. Her hormones, her body, her recovery.

Watch your own mental health too. Partners can experience paternal postpartum depression. Feelings of anxiety, inadequacy, detachment, or hopelessness in yourself warrant professional support.

Avoid the trap of competitive exhaustion. You're both running on empty. Comparison doesn't help. What helps: "How can we help each other through today?"

---

**What's Coming Up**

Week 2 brings incremental improvement. Baby may start having slightly longer sleep stretches (emphasis on "slightly"). Feeding becomes more natural. Mom's physical recovery progresses. But you're still in the woods.

Mark your calendar for her postpartum checkup—ACOG recommends an initial contact within the first 3 weeks, not just the traditional 6-week visit. If she's struggling physically or emotionally before that, contact her OB sooner.
