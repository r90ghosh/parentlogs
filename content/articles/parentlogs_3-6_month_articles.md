### Month 4: The Sleep Regression

**The Quick Brief**

Welcome to month four, where your champion sleeper suddenly forgets how to sleep. Don't panic—this isn't a step backward. Your baby's brain is leveling up, and their sleep architecture is maturing from simple newborn patterns to complex, adult-like sleep cycles. It's frustrating, but it's actually a sign of healthy development.

**What's Happening with Baby**

Around four months, your baby's brain undergoes a significant neurological shift. They're transitioning from the simple two-stage sleep of newborns (REM and non-REM) to the more complex four-stage sleep cycles that adults use. This biological change means your baby will now cycle between light and deep sleep every 60-90 minutes at night and 35-45 minutes during naps—and they may fully wake between each cycle.

Beyond sleep, this month brings exciting developmental milestones. According to the CDC, by four months most babies will hold their head steady without support, hold a toy when you put it in their hand, use their arms to swing at toys, bring hands to mouth, and push up onto elbows when on their tummy. Socially, your baby will smile on their own to get your attention, chuckle when you try to make them laugh, and make cooing sounds like "oooo" and "aahh." They're also becoming more aware of their environment, which contributes to the sleep challenges—they'd rather engage with the world than sleep through it.

**What's Happening with Mom**

By month four, many physical recovery aspects are complete, but this is when return-to-work decisions often become pressing. If your partner is heading back to work, the timing couldn't feel worse with sleep disruption hitting its peak. The sleep regression affects everyone—expect increased fatigue and potentially some tension as you both run on empty.

This is also a critical time for mental health monitoring. Postpartum depression and anxiety can emerge or intensify with sleep deprivation. Watch for signs that go beyond normal exhaustion: persistent sadness, loss of interest in the baby, excessive worry, or feelings of hopelessness. If your partner seems to be struggling more than typical new-parent tired, encourage her to talk with her doctor. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale is commonly used at pediatric checkups—dads can benefit from understanding it too.

**What Dad Should Do Now**

**1. Lower the crib mattress.** Your baby will start attempting to roll over soon, and once they can push up on their arms, the crib becomes a launch pad. Check your crib instructions and lower the mattress to the next setting before you need it—not after your baby demonstrates their new skills.

**2. Decide on a sleep approach with your partner.** The 4-month regression is when many families start considering sleep training. This isn't a solo decision. Have an honest conversation about what feels right for your family. Options range from "ride it out and respond to every cry" to various sleep training methods. The AAP doesn't endorse a specific method but does recommend establishing consistent sleep routines. Whatever you choose, get aligned as a team—consistency matters more than which approach you pick.

**3. Stop swaddling if baby is rolling.** The NIH Safe to Sleep guidelines are clear: once babies start to roll over (usually around 3-4 months), swaddling increases the risk of suffocation and must stop. If your baby can roll from back to stomach or stomach to back, transition them out of the swaddle immediately. Consider a sleep sack as an alternative.

**4. Establish rock-solid bedtime routines.** Predictable sleep cues help your baby's maturing brain recognize that sleep is coming. Dim the lights, give a warm bath, do a feeding, read a book, and use consistent low white noise. The routine itself matters more than the specific activities—do the same thing, in the same order, every night.

**5. Tag-team the night wakings.** If you're not already splitting nighttime duties, now is the time. Create a system that gives each of you a protected sleep window. Even 4-5 hours of uninterrupted sleep makes a meaningful difference in cognitive function and patience.

**The Relationship Check-In**

Sleep deprivation strains even the strongest partnerships. You're both exhausted, potentially snapping at each other, and romance is probably the last thing on either of your minds. This is normal. What matters now is being allies, not adversaries. When discussions about sleep approaches get heated, remember you're both trying to do right by your baby—you just might disagree on tactics.

Small gestures matter: let your partner sleep in on weekend mornings, bring her coffee without being asked, acknowledge how hard this phase is. Don't keep score on night wakings; aim for fairness over the week, not the night. If tensions rise, name it: "I know we're both fried. This phase won't last forever."

**What's Coming Up**

Month five brings more mobility—sitting with support and reaching for everything within (and beyond) their grasp. You'll want to have babyproofing well underway. The good news? For many families, sleep starts to stabilize once babies learn to self-soothe and adjust to their new sleep cycles. Hang in there.

===ARTICLE 2: Month 5: The Mobility Begins===

### Month 5: The Mobility Begins

**The Quick Brief**

Your baby is done being a spectator. Month five marks the transition from "stay where I put you" to "watch me grab literally everything." They're building the strength and coordination that will soon have them sitting, crawling, and eventually walking. Your mission now: get ahead of the mobility curve with proactive babyproofing before your little explorer discovers every hazard in your home.

**What's Happening with Baby**

At five months, your baby is bridging the gap between the 4-month and 6-month developmental milestones. They're likely reaching for toys with intention now—not just batting at them, but actively trying to grab and hold objects. Upper body strength is increasing rapidly; when placed on their tummy, they may push up fully on their hands, not just elbows.

Sitting becomes possible with support. Your baby might sit in a tripod position (leaning forward on their hands) or sit upright when you hold them at the hips. They're not ready for unsupported sitting yet, but the core strength is developing quickly. Some babies begin rocking back and forth on hands and knees—early practice for crawling.

Everything goes in the mouth now. This is how babies explore and learn about objects, and it's completely normal. It's also why babyproofing becomes urgent. Your baby will put anything they can reach into their mouth: coins, pet food, charging cables, small toys, dust bunnies. They don't distinguish between safe and unsafe—that's your job.

Personality is emerging more clearly. You'll notice preferences for certain toys, people, or activities. They may show frustration when a toy is out of reach or excitement when they see a familiar face. This increasing emotional complexity is another sign of healthy development.

**What's Happening with Mom**

By month five, most physical recovery is complete. Energy levels may be slowly returning, though sleep deprivation (especially if the 4-month regression is ongoing) can still take its toll. Many moms are back at work by now or actively preparing for the return.

Pumping routines, if applicable, are typically well-established. Some moms notice supply fluctuations around this time—stress, return-to-work adjustments, and the baby's changing feeding patterns can all play a role. If breastfeeding continues, the CDC notes that breast milk or formula should still be the primary source of nutrition for about the first 6 months.

Identity shifts may surface. After months focused entirely on survival and baby care, some moms start reconnecting with pre-baby interests or grieving their old lifestyle. Both reactions are valid. Encourage your partner to take time for herself if she needs it, whether that's a solo walk, time with friends, or simply a quiet hour with a book.

**What Dad Should Do Now**

**1. Complete Phase 1 babyproofing.** Don't wait until your baby is crawling—do it now. The AAP recommends getting on your hands and knees to see the world from your baby's perspective. Phase 1 priorities include:

- **Outlet covers** on all accessible outlets
- **Cabinet locks** on any cabinets containing cleaning products, chemicals, or medicines. The Poison Help line is 1-800-222-1222—save it in your phone now.
- **Cord management** for blind cords, electronic cables, and lamp cords. Window blind cords are strangulation hazards.
- **Secure furniture** that could tip over when pulled. Anchor bookshelves, dressers, and TVs to the wall.
- **Move choking hazards** out of reach—coins, batteries, small toys, anything that fits through a toilet paper roll.

**2. Install safety gates.** If you have stairs, get gates now. The AAP recommends gates at both the top and bottom of stairs. Hardware-mounted gates are more secure than pressure-mounted for the top of stairs.

**3. Do a daily floor sweep.** This becomes a habit for the next several years. Walk through main living areas each day and pick up small objects that have fallen—dropped earrings, fallen buttons, coins that escaped from pockets. If you have older children or pets, their small toys and kibble become hazards too.

**4. Establish interactive play routines.** Your baby is becoming a more active participant in play. Get on the floor with them daily. Roll a ball toward them, offer toys just slightly out of reach to encourage reaching and grasping, practice supported sitting. This one-on-one floor time builds physical skills and strengthens your bond.

**5. Reassess the crib environment.** Reconfirm that the crib meets safety standards: nothing in the crib except baby and a fitted sheet. No blankets, pillows, toys, or crib bumpers. If you haven't already lowered the mattress, do it now—once babies can push up well, they can potentially tip over the rail.

**The Relationship Check-In**

As your baby becomes more interactive and predictable, you may find small windows opening up in your relationship. Evenings might become slightly more manageable, allowing for brief conversations that aren't just logistics. Take advantage of these moments. Even 15 minutes of dedicated conversation—about something other than the baby—helps maintain connection.

Consider who's carrying the mental load of babyproofing, pediatrician research, and developmental tracking. These invisible tasks can create imbalance. If your partner handles most of the "what does the baby need next" planning, proactively taking ownership of babyproofing shows you're engaged in the anticipatory work of parenting, not just the execution.

**What's Coming Up**

Month six is a milestone month: the pediatric checkup, first solid foods, and likely independent sitting. You're entering a new phase where feeding expands beyond bottles and your baby becomes increasingly mobile. The groundwork you lay now with babyproofing and routines sets you up for that transition.

===ARTICLE 3: Month 6: First Foods===

### Month 6: First Foods

**The Quick Brief**

You've spent six months mastering bottles and milk feeds. Now everything changes. Around six months, babies are developmentally ready to start solid foods—a messy, exciting milestone that opens up a whole new world of nutrition, flavors, and laundry challenges. Understanding the guidelines keeps this transition safe and sets up healthy eating habits that last.

**What's Happening with Baby**

By six months, most babies show the developmental signs of readiness for solid foods. According to the CDC, these include: sitting up alone or with support, controlling head and neck, opening mouth when offered food, swallowing food rather than pushing it back out, bringing objects to mouth, and trying to grasp small objects. Not every baby hits all these signs on the exact six-month mark—some are ready a bit earlier, others a bit later. The CDC and AAP both recommend that solid food introduction should not happen before 4 months and ideally begins around 6 months.

Cognitively, your six-month-old is increasingly curious. The CDC notes that by this age, babies put things in their mouth to explore them, reach to grab toys they want, and close their lips to show they don't want more food. They know familiar people, like to look at themselves in mirrors, and laugh out loud. They're taking turns making sounds with you and may blow "raspberries."

Physically, most babies are sitting with minimal support or can sit independently for brief periods. They may be rolling both ways—front to back and back to front. This increasing mobility and postural control is part of what makes solid food feeding possible.

**What's Happening with Mom**

For many moms, the introduction of solid foods brings mixed emotions. If breastfeeding, this milestone can feel like the beginning of a gradual transition—though the CDC emphasizes that breast milk or formula should remain the primary nutrition source through the first year. Some moms feel relief at sharing the feeding responsibility; others feel unexpected sadness at this first step toward independence.

If pumping at work, some moms start evaluating their timeline. Solid foods don't immediately reduce breast milk or formula needs, but it's a reminder that the intense early feeding phase won't last forever. If your partner has been breastfeeding, offering the first solid foods is a great way for you to step into a new feeding role.

Sleep may finally be stabilizing for many families, though every baby is different. With solid foods on the horizon, some parents hope that "real food" will help babies sleep longer. Research doesn't strongly support this, but the predictability of the six-month stage often brings more consistency in sleep patterns regardless.

**What Dad Should Do Now**

**1. Know the feeding guidelines.** The CDC and AAP have clear recommendations:

- Breast milk or formula remains the primary food source through the first year
- Start with single-ingredient foods and wait 3-5 days before introducing another new food, watching for allergic reactions
- Potentially allergenic foods (eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, dairy, wheat, soy, sesame) should be introduced early—there's no benefit to delaying them
- Avoid honey until age 1 (botulism risk)
- If using infant cereal, vary types (oats, barley, multigrain)—don't rely only on rice cereal due to arsenic concerns
- Foods should be smooth and pureed initially, then progressively thicker as baby's eating skills develop

**2. Set up a dedicated feeding station.** You need a high chair or feeding seat, bibs (many of them), baby spoons, and small bowls. Put a splat mat or old towel under the high chair—this will get messy. Having a consistent location for feeding helps establish the routine.

**3. Participate in first foods experiences.** Don't let the first foods moments be something you only hear about. Be present for those first tastes. Your baby's facial expressions experiencing new flavors are priceless and unrepeatable. Take photos and videos. This is a genuine milestone worth witnessing.

**4. Understand choking hazards.** The CDC provides clear guidance on food preparation:

- Cook foods until soft enough to mash with a fork
- Cut cylindrical foods (hot dogs, sausages, string cheese) into short thin strips—round pieces can block airways
- Cut small round foods (grapes, cherry tomatoes, berries) into small pieces
- Remove all seeds and hard pits from fruit
- Avoid hard, crunchy foods that can't be gummed until they dissolve
- Always supervise eating—never leave a baby alone with food

**5. Watch for hunger and fullness cues.** The CDC notes that pointing to foods, opening mouth for a spoon, or getting excited when seeing food signals hunger. Pushing food away, closing mouth, or turning head away means they're done. Respect these cues—forcing food when baby shows fullness cues can disrupt healthy hunger recognition.

**The Relationship Check-In**

First foods is a milestone that can genuinely be shared. Unlike early breastfeeding, which is biologically mom's domain, solid food feeding is an opportunity for dad to take on equal ownership of a feeding experience. Discuss with your partner how you want to divide this new responsibility. Maybe you own weekend breakfast feeding; maybe you prep the week's purees if you're making your own; maybe you're the one who introduces new foods.

This is also a time to check in on your division of the invisible work. Who researches which foods to introduce? Who makes the pediatrician appointments? Who tracks the feeding schedule? If your partner is carrying most of this mental load, proactively stepping up on the solid foods research front is a concrete way to balance the scales.

**What's Coming Up**

The six-month pediatrician visit is just around the corner—a major checkup with vaccines, growth assessment, and developmental screening. As solid foods become established over the coming weeks, you'll see your baby's diet gradually expand from single-ingredient purees to more complex combinations and textures.

===ARTICLE 4: Month 6: The Six-Month Checkup===

### Month 6: The Six-Month Checkup

**The Quick Brief**

Six months marks a major pediatric milestone: the half-year well-child visit. This appointment is more comprehensive than routine weight checks—it includes developmental screening, vaccines, and a thorough assessment of your baby's growth and progress. This is your chance to get answers to accumulated questions and confirm your baby is on track. Be there.

**What's Happening with Baby**

By the six-month checkup, your baby has developed significantly from that curled-up newborn you first brought home. The CDC's 6-month milestones provide a framework for what pediatricians assess. Socially and emotionally, your baby should know familiar people, like to look at themselves in a mirror, and laugh. For communication, they should take turns making sounds with you, blow raspberries, and make squealing noises.

Cognitively, babies at this age put things in their mouth to explore, reach to grab toys they want, and close their lips to show they don't want more food. Physically, they should be rolling from tummy to back, pushing up with straight arms when on their tummy, and leaning on their hands for support when sitting.

The AAP recommends developmental screening at specific ages. While the standardized screening ages are 9, 18, and 30 months (plus autism screening at 18 and 24 months), the 6-month visit includes developmental monitoring and a chance to discuss any concerns. If you've noticed anything that worries you—unusual movements, lack of expected milestones, regression in skills—this is the time to raise it.

Growth metrics will be assessed: weight, length, and head circumference. These are plotted on growth curves to track your baby's trajectory. What matters most isn't hitting a specific percentile, but following a consistent growth pattern. Pediatricians look for concerning deviations from a baby's established curve.

**What's Happening with Mom**

The six-month mark often brings some closure to the acute postpartum period. Many of the physical recovery questions are resolved, and routines are generally more established. That said, postpartum depression and anxiety can emerge at any point in the first year, so ongoing awareness matters.

If your partner is breastfeeding or pumping, the pediatrician may discuss the transition to solid foods and what it means for milk feeding going forward. The clear guidance: breast milk or formula remains the primary nutrition source through 12 months, even as solid foods are introduced.

For moms who've returned to work, the six-month mark can be a natural point to evaluate how the work-life balance is functioning. Some moms adjust schedules, childcare arrangements, or pumping routines based on what they've learned in the first months back.

**What Dad Should Do Now**

**1. Attend the appointment.** This isn't optional. The six-month visit is one of the most important pediatric checkups of the first year. Being present shows your partner you're a co-parent, gives you direct access to the pediatrician, and ensures you hear the same information firsthand rather than through secondhand summary.

**2. Prepare questions in advance.** Don't rely on remembering everything in the moment. Keep a running note on your phone over the week before the appointment. Common topics for the 6-month visit include:

- Solid food introduction—when, what, how much
- Sleep patterns and what's developmentally normal
- Teething and pain management
- Any specific developmental concerns
- What milestones to watch for next
- Vaccine schedule and what to expect

**3. Understand the vaccines.** The 6-month vaccine schedule typically includes doses of DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis), polio, Hib, pneumococcal, rotavirus, and possibly hepatitis B and flu (depending on season and prior doses). Research shows that vaccinated babies are at lower risk for SIDS, in addition to being protected from serious and potentially fatal diseases. Know what shots your baby will receive so you can help with comfort measures afterward.

**4. Know the growth context.** If your pediatrician mentions percentiles, understand what they mean. A baby in the 25th percentile for weight isn't "failing"—it means 25% of babies weigh less and 75% weigh more. What matters is consistent growth along the baby's own curve. A drop from the 75th to the 25th percentile over a few months would warrant investigation; steady tracking at the 25th percentile is perfectly healthy.

**5. Discuss any concerns directly.** Pediatricians can only address concerns you raise. If you've noticed anything—unusual fussiness, feeding difficulties, sleep problems, movements that seem off, lack of expected milestones—say so. The CDC emphasizes that parents know their child best and encourages acting early if concerns exist. Early intervention services are available in every state for babies who need developmental support.

**The Relationship Check-In**

Attending medical appointments together reinforces that you're parenting as a team. If work constraints make it genuinely impossible to be at every appointment, ensure this major checkup is on your calendar well in advance. Consider trading off—if your partner has attended all the earlier visits solo, making this one a priority demonstrates commitment.

After the appointment, debrief together. What did the pediatrician say? What were the key takeaways? What needs follow-up? Having these conversations ensures you're both operating from the same information and prevents one parent from becoming the sole keeper of medical knowledge.

**What's Coming Up**

The next few months bring increasing mobility—many babies begin crawling between 6-10 months, and some start pulling to stand. Solid foods will expand from single-ingredient purees to more complex combinations. The 9-month checkup will include the first standardized developmental screening. You're exiting the newborn phase and entering the active, exploratory baby phase. Buckle up.
